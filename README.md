# Interactive-Adventure-Generator
Create your own story and make decisions that can lead you to success or failure. Choose wisely

This project contains the notebooks developed for the capstone project of the [5-day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google](https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/google-generative-ai-intensive_2025q1)

# TODO
Start with Notebooks/interactive-adventure-generator-submission.ipynb (the file that was submitted to the course, and has a working MVP)
1. Port the notebook content to an app.py
2. Generate project structure (gitignore, dockerignore, folder structure, requirements.txt, etc)
3. Change gemini model API to another free LLM, and one that does not require generating an API Key (setting an environment variable is not great for user experience)
4. Create requirements.txt. The packages available in the notebooks environment are listed in pip_freeze_content
5. Create docker image
6. Improve README.md
7. Host the project
